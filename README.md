# Predictive Modelling in Property and Casualty Insurance

This project focuses on developing predictive models for estimating claim severity within Property and Casualty insurance using machine learning techniques in Python. The models use data to predict loss severity and help insurers better assess risks.

## Project Structure:
- `main.py`: The main script to run the predictive models.
- `data/`: Directory for storing datasets.
- `models/`: Directory containing model scripts like decision tree and logistic regression.
- `scripts/`: Data processing and utility scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- `requirements.txt`: File containing the required Python dependencies.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mobucheeri/Predictive_Modelling_PnC.git

  pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py

This command runs the main script, which currently prints a welcome message. Future versions will include the implementation of the predictive models.

## Dataset
Place the dataset in the `data/` folder. You can use a dataset such as the [Allstate Claims Severity Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/data).

Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` folder in CSV format. This dataset contains features and a target variable for claim severity prediction, making it a suitable example for this project.
